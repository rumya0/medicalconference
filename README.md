# Web Scraping using Scrapy (Medical Conferences)
This repository contains a web scraping project done as part of the ACEA Data Science Internship application process.

The following website has details of medical conferences happening worldwide.
https://www.omicsonline.org/medical-conferences.php

The goal of the project was to compile details of the conferences into a .csv file. The following details of the conferences were scraped using Scrapy with primarily CSS extractors:

1. Title of the conference
2. Date of the conference
3. Conference venue

Both .json and .csv files were created using the code. The .csv file is included in the repository for your reference.
