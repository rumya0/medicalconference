# Web Scraping using Scrapy (Medical Conferences)
This repository contains a web scraping project done as part of the ACEA Data Science Internship application process.

The following website has details of medical conferences happening worldwide.
https://www.omicsonline.org/medical-conferences.php

The goal of the project was to compile details of the conferences into a .csv file. The following details of the conferences were scraped using Scrapy with primarily CSS extractors:

1. Title of the conference
2. Date of the conference
3. Conference venue

Both .json and .csv files were created using the code. The .csv file is included in the repository for your reference. 

# Why did I choose this project?
I chose this project for two reasons:
1. The first step to getting a good solution to a problem start with good data. Webscraping gives you the ability and freedom to obtain necessary data required for the problem at hand. Webscraping enables one to create a customized dataset from the vast ocean of information online and I wanted to learn the skills of obtaining good data from relevant sources.
2. Scrapy is a flexible package for webscraping and I wanted to become better at it.
